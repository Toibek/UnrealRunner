# Unreal Runner
An enless runner made in unreal using primarily c++ to make stuff function for an assignment for a course in FutureGames Programming.

I've honestly had some major issues regarding starting work with UE5, didn't really get stuff working at all untill today(24/4-23) basically. 
wich also happens to be the deadline for the first part of the assignment.
