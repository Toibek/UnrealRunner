# Unreal Runner

Had some issues on the day for the Part 1 of the assignment, 
I accidentally lost all the files i had that got it working and managed to build the day after, 
sorry about the delay.

An enless runner made in unreal using primarily c++ to make stuff function for an assignment for a course in FutureGames Programming.

I've honestly had some major issues regarding starting work with UE5, didn't really get stuff working at all untill today(24/4-23) basically. 
wich also happens to be the deadline for the first part of the assignment.

## What's there so far
So far i got a basic spherical character moving and some blocks spawning, that then move in the direction of the player. set up a static camera so you can see properly and set it up so that it's a variable playfield.

## What's next
So the plan for the coming two weeks, for part two goes as follows

1. Globalize the settings for the map.
2. Make the player have health and die and respawn (3 health in accordance with the assignment, make variable cause why not)
3. Some sort of start / loss menu
4. Score based on time
5. Save the score and display highscore on start & death
6. Implement enemy spheres that shoot projectiles
7. ability to shoot back to the enemies
8. Enemy death adds to the score

Hopefully i can get this working but i hope this is good enough for part 1 at least.
